# AlgoAtlas - Financial Analytics Platform

## Overview
AlgoAtlas is an advanced financial analytics platform that provides machine learning models for:
- Price Prediction (LSTM, ARIMA, Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- Volatility Modeling (LSTM, GARCH, Attention Models)
- Portfolio Forecasting (VaR, DeepAR, Transformer Models)
- Anomaly Detection (Autoencoders, Isolation Forest, HDBSCAN)

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (migrated from Supabase)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom server setup
